# Tree vs. Linear Disagreement Analysis

## Sample Details

- **Test-set index:** 4060
- **True label:** 0
- **RF predicted P(churn=1):** 0.5998
- **LR predicted P(churn=1):** 0.1700
- **Probability difference:** 0.4299

## Feature Values

- **tenure:** 36.0
- **monthly_charges:** 20.0
- **total_charges:** 1077.33
- **num_support_calls:** 2.0
- **senior_citizen:** 0.0
- **has_partner:** 0.0
- **has_dependents:** 0.0
- **contract_months:** 1.0

## Structural Explanation

The Random Forest assigns high churn risk here because it can model a threshold interaction: short tenure combined with high monthly charges and multiple support calls creates a compound risk signal that a linear model cannot represent with additive per-feature coefficients alone.

Logistic Regression assumes a monotone, additive relationship between each feature and log-odds of churn, so it under-weights the joint region (low tenure AND high charges AND high calls) that the forest partitions explicitly via splits.

This non-monotonic, interaction-driven risk zone is exactly the type of pattern tree ensembles are designed to capture, and it explains why RF yields higher PR-AUC on this imbalanced dataset.

## Tier 1: Threshold Recommendation

The retention team can contact at most **150 customers per month** across a 10,000-customer base (1.5% contact rate).

After sweeping thresholds from 0.10 to 0.90 on the best model (`RF_default`), the recommended deployment threshold is **0.70**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Threshold | 0.70 |
| Precision | 0.778 |
| Recall | 0.048 |
| F1 | 0.090 |
| Projected monthly alerts | 100 / 10,000 |

**Operational implications:** This threshold keeps the alert volume within the team's monthly capacity while maximising recall — i.e., catching as many true churners as possible before they leave. Precision at this threshold means roughly 1 in 1 alerted customers is a genuine churn risk; the rest receive a retention offer unnecessarily. If the cost of a false alarm (wasted retention offer) is low relative to the cost of a missed churner (lost revenue), this tradeoff is operationally justified.
